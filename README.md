## 📌 Current Phase
I am actively improving the project by working on:
- Adding **REST Controllers**  
- Creating **API endpoints**  
- Implementing **Spring Security** for authentication & authorization

This project is inspired by the Spring Boot tutorial by **Anuj Kumar Sharma** on YouTube/GitHub.  
I learned the core concepts from his content and expanded/customized the implementation during my learning journey.

## 📂 Project Status
This is a work-in-progress learning project. I will continue updating it with new features and improvements.
